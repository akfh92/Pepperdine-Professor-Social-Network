# Pepperdine-Professor-Social-Network
Social Network Service for professors at Pepperdine University.
<br/><br/><br/>
**Description**:<br/>
Welcome Onboard fellow Students and Developers, This is where you can find resources to make a Social Netwrok Service for professors at Pepperdine University. Currently, professors at Pepperdine are having problem communicating with each other when collaborating on a research or when they want to ask fellow professors for guidance. In order to solve this problem, I have decided to launch a social network for them where they can look up each others past research papers and gather information about other professors. You are free to contribute in anyway. You can also use it to make a Social Network Service for professors at your school or perhaps any organzation. Unfortunately I cannot share some of the database information because they have sensitive information on professors at Pepperdine, but since almost every institution are having the same problems, you can use this as a guidance to a SNS for your institution. <br/><br/>
